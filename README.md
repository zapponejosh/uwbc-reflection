# Reflection After project 2

## The Journey so Far

### What have I learned so far?
Most of my learning has been around hard skills but also learning how to learn. I have learned a lot of JavaScript and how websites and applications are put together from nothing to an actual product. I also learned how to be creative with code to solve problems. A good example of this is the calendar displayed on Breakaway. It was something that I didn't want to be in 1.0 at first but Jon and Dan really wanted to do. They started on it but were having a few issues and I had some time near the end of the project so instead of scrapping it I jumped in and had to figure out how I could create a calendar from scratch from thethe current date and displaying information from our approved time off requests.

### What have I accomplished
I was pretty stoked to have our group win most likely to get funded and best in show for project two. Besides building something I could proudly put on portfolio I really wanted that. I think as a group we put in a ton of work and for myself I know I put in a lot into this project. It meant a lot of learning but it also meant a _lot_ of long nights. I also am proud of what we created for project one but I felt much more limited by our knowledge at that point.

### How have I grown since week 1?
One of my favorite quotes that I discovered early on during this course is "learning is hard work but everything you learn is yours and will make subsequent learning easier." I have held on to that quote and it has encouraged me to lean into the things that are hard to learn and keep grinding when things are not making sense. That mentality has forced me to grow a lot as a developer and especially as a learner. 
The second area of growth has been around our group projects. I have learned how to work on a team to deliver on a product. That has meant listening to the ideas of other group members and, as project manager, trying to help them deliver on their code instead of stepping in trying to do it myself. Technically, I have gotten even better at git and sharing a codebase.

## Path to Success

### Goals for the remainder of th course
My goals moving forward are to continue developing my portfolio and skills so that I feel comfortable taking a project from start to finish by myself using all the technologies in the bootcamp. Also, to get a developer job as soon as possible.

## What do I hope to accomplish before completing the course?
Besides becoming familiar with React and surrounding technologies I would like to have the skills to impress an employer andhave my career materials prepared and polished.

### What do I hope to accomplish after the course
I would like to a land a dev job. Preferably as a junior dev with a mostly remote job working on a product that is exciting (at least a little).

### Strategies for accomplishing goals
Although learning new tech is very exciting, at the moment I want to focus on learning our course objectives very well and becoming profficient in all the technologoies we use, so I can more easily pick up new tech moving forward. I also will be meeing with my career driector regularly and putting in job applications.

### How have my goals changed from the first half of the course?
These are not so much different goals as they are the next step for me as I begin to shift my focus from learning and discovery to getting a job -- being able to do well on interviews, build a portfolio, and potentially work on side projects to hone my skills as well as actually applying for jobs.
